# Blockchain Game Software Development Kit (BGSDK): Foundation

Heathen Engineering's BGSDK Foundation allows you to manage in-game items as blockchain assets. It is a complete wrapper around [Arkane Network](https://arkane.network/)'s Web API. The tool simplifies integration with Arkane API exposing all features and functions to C# classes and includes Editor extensions to aid in design and deployment of Contracts and Tokens.
